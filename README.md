Summary
-----------
I collected korean newspaper articles related to nuclear energy and analyzed the articles by Author-topic Model. By this analysis, researchers try to expore the nuclear energy discourse of south korea and critically review the existing analysis frames of earlier works. Furthermore, based on the result of my analysis, collaborators suggest an alternative analytic frame for nuclear energy and crisis management.
