===============
Changdong Oh(with Teajun Lee, Seungbae Lee, Huekyung Won)

Summary
-----------
I collected korean newspaper articles related to nuclear energy and analyzed the articles by Author-topic Model. By this analysis, researchers try to expore the nuclear energy discourse of south korea and critically review the existing analysis frames of earlier works. Furthermore, based on the result of my analysis, collaborators suggest an alternative analytic frame for nuclear energy and crisis management.

Data
--------
In this research, I gathered 29565 newspaper articles to analyze public opinion toward nuclear energy according to two criteria. First, it should contain words 'nuclear energy(원자력)' or 'nuclear power(원전)' to pick only relevant articles. Second, I restricted the period of article from 2014 to 2016. In the data collecting process, I used the Naver and Daum, which are the largest internews news portal sites in South Korea.

Additionally, I collected 925 official announcements of several governmental organizations related to the nuclear energy industry of south korea.

Codes used in this procedure are saved on script/newscrawling folder.

Analysis
--------
I adopted an Author-Topic Model[(Rosen-Zvi et al. 2004)](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1036902), which is well-known modified version of Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
